The **Perceptron** has several limitations:

1. **Only Works for Linearly Separable Data**
    - It fails if the data is not linearly separable (e.g., XOR problem).
2. **No Probability Outputs**
    - Outputs only discrete values (-1 or 1), not probabilities like Logistic Regression.
3. **Sensitive to Initialization & Learning Rate**
    - If weights are poorly initialized, it may converge slowly or not at all.
4. **Cannot Handle Overlapping Classes**
    - No margin like SVM; may misclassify noisy or overlapping data.
5. **No Concept of Confidence**
    - Unlike sigmoid or softmax, it doesnâ€™t provide confidence scores.

AND and OR operations are linearly separable, while XOR is not.
