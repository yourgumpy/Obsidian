This MLP has 26 parameters that we can identify.

â†’ Now time to see the notations of weights and biases

## Bias Notation

Bias is notated by $b_{ij}$ ; where

- i = layer number
- j = node number

## Output Notation

Output is notated by $O_{ij}$ ; where

- i = layer number of the bias node it is coming from
- j = node number of the bias node it is coming from

Actually it is similar to the bias notation node it is coming from

## Weight notation

Weight is notated by $W_{ij}^k$ ; where

- k = Layer number to which it is entering
- i = Node number from which the weight is coming (previous layer)
- j = Node number to which the weight is entering (current layer)
